# How we work?

We utilize a lightweight Agile methodology for project management. All code and project artifacts reside within GitHub, facilitating backlog management, iterations, and task assignment.

## Backlog Management:
- All work would be tracked as GitHub Issues
>- Issues can be labelled as epic, user story or task ( See Labels below for more details)
>- Each issue would also be assigned a target Iteration.
- An iteration is (currently) a 12 week calendar window.Any issue targetted for a particular iteration is expected to be completed within that iteration.
- A single product backlog consolidates epics, user stories, and other issues.
>- Dedicated _project boards_ offer clear visualizations of the backlog, including both the complete backlog and ongoing work.

## Project Board
All work would be managed in a project - [RAG MultiModal Project](https://github.com/orgs/palasangha/projects/11/)
This will have 2 views
- Backlog view : showing the entire backlog
- Current Iteration:  work that is planned for current iteration


## Project Planning:
- Project planning employs a simple, lightweight approach.
- The team reviews all issue in the project board ( last week of the previous iteration)
- Updates the _iteration_ field appropriately
- To maintain focus, we recommend limiting in-progress epics to two and user stories to three to five.
  
## GitHub Organization:
  
### Labels
Labels represent various types of issue or relavant projects
> - Type.Bug: Bug type issue
> - Type.Epic : Higher level customer , will contain a list of userstories
> - Type.UserStory : Unit of work., can be user facing or internal
> - Type.Task : Broken down unit of work to complete a user story
		
> - Project.Text : Any tasks related to Text Modal
> - Project.Image:Any tasks related to ImageModal
> - Project.Audio:Any tasks related to AudioModal
> - Project.Video:Any tasks related to VideoModal
> - Project.MultiModal:Any tasks related to MultiModal
	
	
### Iteration
There will be one iteration per Calendar Quarter. All issues targeted for a quarter will be set with the corresponding Iteration
	
### Status
> - ToDo : All issues will be automatically land as "ToDo"
> - Inprogress : Issues that are currently in progress
> - Complete : Issues that are complete


### Workflow:
- All issues automatically start with a "To Do" status.
- The status progresses to "In Progress" when actively worked upon and "Complete" upon successful completion.



## Communication & Tools:
- Slack serves as our primary communication platform, with a GitHub app integration for progress tracking and updates. (todo)
- Standardized issue templates for epics and user stories are in development. (todo)
