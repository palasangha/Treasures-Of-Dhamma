The online publication compliments the exhibition by the same name that was on view at the RISD Museum June 30 –December 3, 2017. In late 19th-century Paris, the printmaking process of etching underwent a revolutionary transformation. At a time when prints were usually made as copies of paintings rather than as original works of art, a revival of interest in etching led to greater knowledge of technique, allowing artists to experiment with subject matter and process more than ever before. The publication focuses on the creativity and experimentation that proliferated in these years, during and after etching’s revival, and the centrality in this important shift.""",https://alteredstates.risdmuseum.org/altered-states/,"[{""name_uri"": ""http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81119253"",""role_uri"":""http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/pbl"",""agent_type"":""corporate"",""name_label"":""Rhode Island School of Design.

He left little record of himself, but an invaluable one of his surroundings and interests. Stonebridge lived at several locations in the Bronx with his wife Bella, and their three children Grace, George, and William. He worked at the Northern Gaslight Company, although the position he held is unknown. In addition to taking photographs, Stonebridge wrote poetry and prose about his love of the Bronx, his children, and in honor of military victories. Some of Stonebridge's photographs appeared in local papers. In 1898, he was an authorized reporter and photographer for the North Side News; in 1905 he was an authorized reporter for the Bronx Borough Record and Times, and probably took photographs for that paper as well. Stonebridge was fascinated with the subject of military preparedness. Training rituals and staged battles were one of his favorite photographic subjects. His 1898 poem, ""Remember the Maine,"" celebrates the United States' victory in the Spanish-American War. He was especially proud of soldiers from the Bronx, and photographed historical tablets throughout the Borough commemorating previous military victories. Stonebridge also used his photographs to illustrate lectures.

The Tinguiririca Fauna of the Andean Main Range of central Chile is remarkable for its abundant and diverse archaeohyracids. This study recognizes four relatively large-bodied species from the Tinguiririca Fauna, two of which are new. Together with two previously described small-bodied forms, the total of six species makes the archaeohyracid assemblage from Tinguiririca the most diverse known, representing the co-occurrence of at least 40% of all archaeohyracid species in a single fauna. The two new archaeohyracids are referred to Archaeotypotherium (A. tinguiriricaense and A. pattersoni), for which a revised diagnosis also is presented. The revision synonymizes the Argentine taxa Archaeohyrax propheticus, Archaeotypotherium transitum, and Archaeohyrax (""Bryanpattersonia"") nesodontoides under Archaeotypotherium propheticus (new combination). Four specimens from central Chile, including three mandibular fragments and one partial upper dental series, are referred to the two existing species of Pseudhyrax. The upper dental series is one of the best examples known for the taxon, and is referred to Pseudhyrax cf. P. eutrachytheroides. Based on a metric study of Pseudhyrax specimens from Argentina, one of the Chilean mandibles is referred to Pseudhyrax eutrachytheroides, one to Pseudhyrax strangulatus, and a third to Pseudhyrax sp. indet. Analysis of a large sample of Archaeohyrax specimens from Salla, Bolivia, provides the basis for interpreting wear-related metric variation in archaeohyracid tooth dimensions. It demonstrates that most cheek teeth decrease in length and increase in width through increasing wear, although upper and lower third molars are exceptions. Owing to the dramatic metric and morphologic differences between worn and unworn archaeohyracid teeth, care should be taken when interpreting the systematic significance of metric differences among specimens of different wear states. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggests that taxa traditionally included in the Archaeohyracidae do not form a monophyletic group exclusive of Hegetotheriidae and that a comprehensive review of the names associated with major clades of typothere notoungulates is needed.
