This view by Utagawa Hiroshige (1797-1858) shows the great bridge of Senju crossing the Arakawa River. The Senju Bridge was built in 1594 and stood for nearly 300 years until it was washed away in the great flood of 1885. Mount Buk ̥(4,383 feet) is also depicted. The superb printing of the wood grain and the crisp detail attests that this image is an early edition.
